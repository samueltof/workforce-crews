This article and subheading were amended on 29 September 2024. An earlier version said that the S&P 500 index had registered a near 100% gain on a year ago when that should have said five years ago. It has risen 34% in the last year.Explore more on these topicsStock marketsInterest ratesEconomicsInflationChinaEuropeFederal ReservenewsShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyGlobal stock markets plunge amid ‚ÄòTrump tariff tantrum‚Äô3h ago‚ÄòSputnik moment‚Äô: $1tn wiped off US stocks after Chinese firm unveils AI chatbot7d agoWall Street shrugs off Trump after he vows Mexico and Canada tariffs21 Jan 2025A year of two halves: how global financial markets fared in 20241 Jan 2025Global markets tipped to keep rising in 2025 despite trade war fears30 Dec 2024Chinese stocks suffer worst fall in 27 years over growth concerns9 Oct 2024Threat to stock markets comes from China and Middle East, not the US11 Aug 2024Why August is one of the most dangerous months in the financial calendar9 Aug 2024Most viewedMost viewedBusinessEconomicsBankingMoneyMarketsProject SyndicateB2BRetailNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us¬†Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top¬© 2025 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

      "NEW YORK (AP) ‚Äî U.S. stocks ripped higher Wednesday following a shot of adrenaline from an encouraging update on U.S. inflation. Strong profit reports from Wells Fargo and other big U.S. banks also helped launch indexes to their best day in two months.The S&P 500 jumped 1.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 703 points, or 1.7%, and the Nasdaq composite leaped 2.5%. Treasury yields also eased in the bond market following the update on how much more U.S. households had to pay in December for eggs, gasoline, housing and other costs of living. The report said overall inflation accelerated to 2.9% from 2.7% in November.While no one wants higher inflation, the numbers were more encouraging underneath the surface. After ignoring prices for food and energy, which can zigzag sharply from month to month, underlying inflation trends slowed to 3.2% in December. Economists had thought it would remain at 3.3% for a fourth straight month, according to FactSet. \n",
      "The Federal Reserve pays more attention to that underlying number than the overall figure, and it‚Äôs particularly welcome following worries that improvements in inflation have halted and that it will be tough to get all the way down to the Fed‚Äôs 2% target. RELATED COVERAGE\n",

      "Stock market today: Wall Street surrenders gains after White House confirms Trump tariff move\n",
      "Wall Street expects airlines to see sustained demand for travel this year\n",
      "Few traders expect Wednesday‚Äôs data to convince the Fed to cut its main interest rate at its meeting later this month, as it‚Äôs done at three straight meetings since September. But economists and analysts say it could open the door for cuts later in the year, maybe even in March, if more data comes in to show that upward pressure on inflation is abating. \n",
      "‚ÄúPerhaps the key takeaway is that markets are likely to be whipsawed over the next few data releases as investors seek a narrative that they can be comfortable with for more than just a few days at a time,‚Äù said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. \n",
      "Wall Street has been lurching down and up for weeks as traders tear up their forecasts for what the Fed will do with interest rates in 2025. A further easing would boost the U.S. economy and prices for investments, but it could also give inflation more fuel.Traders were ebullient last year about the possibility of a string of cuts to rates, when they sent stocks to dozens of all-time highs, only to rein in their expectations more recently. The Fed itself has indicated it may cut rates only two times this year instead of the four it had earlier projected, and some traders have even considered the possibility of future hikes to rates. Wednesday‚Äôs update quashed speculation about hikes in the near term, and Treasury yields eased in the bond market on growing hopes for coming cuts. The yield on the 10-year Treasury dropped back to 4.65% from 4.79% late Tuesday, which is a considerable move. It had largely been screaming higher since September, when it was below 3.65%.The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed‚Äôs upcoming actions, fell to 4.26% from 4.37%. On Wall Street, bank stocks helped lead the way after several reported stronger profits for the last three months of 2024 than analysts expected. \n",
      "Wells Fargo jumped 6.7%, Citigroup rallied 6.5% and Goldman Sachs gained 6%. They‚Äôre among the first big U.S. companies to report their results for the end of 2024, and even more focus may be on them than usual. When Treasury yields are climbing and bonds are paying more in interest, it cranks up the pressure on stock prices by peeling investors away from stocks and into bonds. To make up for it, stock prices typically either have to fall or corporate profits have to rise more strongly. Stocks of companies that would get a big benefit from lower interest rates were also toward the front of the market.Builders FirstSource, a supplier of countertops and other building materials, rose 4.7%, for example. It and other housing-related companies would get a boost from easier mortgage rates.All told, the S&P 500 rose 107.00 points to 5,949.91. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 703.27 to 43,221.55, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 466.84 to 19,511.23.\n",
      "The encouraging U.S. inflation data also helped to perk up stock indexes abroad by lowering the pressure on the global bond market. The FTSE 100 in London rallied 1.2%. U.K. markets have been under pressure because of a jump in bond yields amid worries about a sluggish economy and the country‚Äôs finances. Indexes also rose 0.7% in France and 1.5% in Germany. They were more subdued in Asia, where trading closed before the release of the U.S. inflation data.South Korea‚Äôs Kospi was nearly unchanged after law enforcement officials detained impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol on Wednesday in connection with his failed declaration of martial law last month.___AP Writer Zimo Zhong contributed.

      "\n",
      "**1. Overview of US Inflation Trends:**\n",
      "   - Recent data indicates a decline in US inflation rates with the annual inflation rate recorded at 2.2% in August 2024, the lowest since February 2021. This decline has fostered expectations for aggressive interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in the coming months, potentially by up to 0.5 percentage points.\n",
      "   - As inflation rates decrease, the S&P 500 index has soared to record highs, registering a 34% year-on-year gain, largely attributed to favorable inflation reports and economic policies in response to inflationary pressures.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Stock Market Performance:**\n",
      "   - The positive inflation data has resulted in significant gains across major stock indices. The S&P 500 jumped 1.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by 703 points (1.7%), and the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.5%. This surge is coupled with strong profit reports from major banks, which bolstered investor confidence.\n",
      "   - The anticipation of lower interest rates is expected to lead to increased economic activity, which will support both stock prices and investment flows into the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Investor Sentiment and Economic Outlook:**\n",
      "   - Analysts expect ongoing volatility in the markets as investors react to changing narratives related to inflation and Federal Reserve policies. The continued focus will be on additional economic indicators signaling whether inflationary pressures will persist or recede.\n",
      "   - Some voices in the market predict potential recessions if further measures to enhance borrowing and investment are not implemented, especially amid slowing growth in key economies like the US and China.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Global Impact and Comparisons:**\n",
      "   - The encouraging news regarding US inflation is having a positive ripple effect on stock markets globally, with significant gains noted in European indices like the FTSE 100, DAX, and CAC 40.\n",
      "   - International bodies, including the IMF, have highlighted that a synchronized reduction in inflation signals could benefit global economic recovery and alleviate pressures in other markets as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Projections for 2024:**\n",
      "   - Economists foresee that if inflation continues to stabilize or decline, we could witness multiple interest rate cuts throughout the year, supporting further growth in equity markets.\n",
      "   - The need for ongoing monitoring of inflation trends and labor market data will dictate stock market movements and investment strategies ahead.\n",

In this scenario, continued geopolitical conflicts and trade actions cause inflation to stay higher for longer, driving the Federal Reserve to hike rates.1 Scenarios Baseline (70%): Real GDP growth slowed overall in the first quarter of 2024, coming in very close to our previous forecast‚Äôs expectations.2 We expect GDP growth will continue to moderate through the second half of this year and the start of the next, but the story is still positive overall. Consumer spending is forecasted to rise 2.3% this year, up from the 2.2% increase in 2023. Business investment is expected to increase 3% in 2024, down from 4.5% last year. Government spending is forecasted to rise 2.5%. Given that the US economy is expected to outperform many other global economies in the short term, we forecast imports to increase 3.1% on average in 2024, while exports are predicted to rise at a slower pace of 2.4%. Consumer price index (CPI) inflation stays above the 3% threshold for the second quarter of this year before falling to 2.7% by the end of 2024. The Federal Reserve succeeds in walking the tightrope to a soft landing by cutting rates twice in the second half of 2024 and continues with cuts until reaching the neutral rate of 2.5% to 3% by 2027. Job growth slows because current levels of job formation are not sustainable, given demographics and labor force participation. As a result, the unemployment rate falls in the short term, but rises to just under 4% in 2025 before gradually declining through the rest of the forecast period. Major investments prompted by the Inflation Reduction Act provide a boost to manufacturing.3 In addition, investments in intellectual property‚Äîsuch as the use of AI and other novel technologies‚Äîwill continue to drive growth in the business sector.

Our forecast is also based on an assumption that long-term trend inflation will converge to 2%. We do believe the Fed will do everything necessary to make inflation converge to 2%, even if it means a slower pace of cuts‚Äîor further rate hikes.

      "general sentiment in markets that the pace and timing of interest rate cuts will not be as aggressive as was once expected. We expect rate cuts will continue at a faster clip in 2025 and 2026 as inflation comes down in earnest, with rates returning to neutral by the first quarter of 2027. Modelling from the New York Fed, and recent comments from the heads of several regional Feds, suggests the neutral rate now rests around 2.5% to 3%.23 In addition, the Fed does not traditionally allow election cycles to influence its rate policy, and in past election years, it has shown a willingness to cut or hike rates according to the economy‚Äôs needs.24 Overall, we predict the Federal Open Market Committee to cut rates a total of eight times over the 2025 to 2026 period, bringing the target rate to 2.75% to 3% by the end of 2026. Share image Share twitter linkedin facebook Or copy link Copy Share image Share twitter linkedin facebook Or copy link Copy Prices While CPI inflation has declined from its June 2022 peak, it is not falling as rapidly as we previously forecasted. As of April 2024, 12-month CPI inflation was running at 3.4%, which is slightly lower than the 3.5% year-over-year increase recorded in March, but higher than the values recorded at the start of the year. However, 12-month core CPI inflation slowed to 3.6%, down from 3.8% recorded in March and the lowest year-over-year growth captured since April 2021. The Federal Reserve‚Äôs preferred measure, personal consumption expenditure inflation, rose slightly in March to 2.7% year-over year growth. While closer to the Federal Reserve‚Äôs target of 2%, it is still above the target, and the pace of decrease in inflation has slowed. Getting inflation down near 2% will require more time. Our forecast therefore assumes that headline CPI inflation will remain above 3% for the first half of 2024, driven in part by temporarily elevated oil prices, before declining steadily starting in the second half of the year.
